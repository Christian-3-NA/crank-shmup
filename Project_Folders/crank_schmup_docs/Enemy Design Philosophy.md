#### Two general categories of enemies:
- Forced Kill: these enemies will linger on the screen, pestering you until you get rid of them.
- Optional Kill: these enemies can fly past you without interaction, you have to go out of your way to kill them for points.
#### More specific enemy classes are:
- Aimer Type: flies to their firing point and shoots bullets directly at the player
- Pattern Type: flies to their firing point and shoots a set pattern of bullets
- Charger Type: flies to their firing point, then charges directly at the player
- Track Type: follows a set path across the board

### Factions
There are roughly 5 factions in the game, the player will encounter only 3 in each run. They should specialize in 2-3 of the enemy classes, using each in a different way.


#### Possible enemies:
- Sniper (Aimer): gives plenty of time before doing a sure-hit shot
- Hunter (Charger): follows the player at a slow pace with a large health pool
- Trackshot (Aimer/Track): simple mix of aimer and track types, dangerous when part of a line of enemies but should have low health
- Vortex (Pattern): shots rotate around this enemy, not too dangerous until they've lived for a long time

## Wave Types
Three different kinds of waves to spawn
- Boss Wave: stars the boss, only some will have supporting enemies. More likely to have additional enemies on later waves (gets more difficult the later they show up)
- Key Wave: intentionally designed waves to act as checkpoints during 5-minute segments. One at the start to introduce faction-specific enemy types, and probably another at 2:30 for a mid-round challenge spike and 4:00 to act as a challenge before the boss
- Between Wave: fills the space between Key Waves, lets the player get plenty of stat boosts without being stressful.
